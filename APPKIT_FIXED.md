# AppKit Configuration Fixed! ✅

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ **Syntax Errors Resolved:**
- Fixed missing opening parenthesis in AppKit constructor
- Corrected property names (`defaultNetworkId` → `defaultNetwork`, `walletConnectProjectId` → `projectId`, `appMetadata` → `metadata`)
- Added required `sdkVersion` property with correct format

### ✅ **Network Configuration Updated:**
- Replaced custom network objects with wagmi chain definitions (`mainnet`, `sepolia`)
- Updated from deprecated Goerli to Sepolia testnet
- Simplified configuration to only essential properties

### ✅ **Error Handling Improved:**
- Error boundary catches AppKitProvider errors gracefully
- Console warnings when WalletConnect Project ID is missing
- Graceful degradation when Project ID is not configured

## Current Configuration

The AppKit is now configured with:
- **SDK Version**: `html-wagmi-4.2.2`
- **Networks**: Sepolia (testnet) or Mainnet based on environment
- **Project ID**: From environment variable `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`
- **Metadata**: App name, description, URL, and icons

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Project ID**: Make sure your `.env` file has the correct WalletConnect Project ID
2. **Test Wallet Connection**: Try connecting a wallet to see if the 403 errors are resolved
3. **Check Console**: Look for any remaining warnings or errors

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ No more "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" errors
- ✅ AppKitProvider should initialize without crashing
- ✅ Wallet connection should work with valid Project ID
- ✅ Error boundary will catch any remaining issues gracefully

The configuration is now properly structured and should work with your WalletConnect Project ID!
