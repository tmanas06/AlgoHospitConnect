# ‚úÖ AppKit and Algorand Integration Fixed!

## Issues Resolved

### üîß **AppKit Configuration Fixed:**
- **Removed incompatible @reown/appkit**: The library was designed for EVM chains, not Algorand
- **Switched to @perawallet/connect**: Proper Algorand wallet integration
- **Fixed network configuration**: Now uses Algorand testnet/mainnet instead of Ethereum
- **Eliminated map error**: No more `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` errors

### üîó **Algorand Integration Implemented:**
- **Real Pera Wallet connection**: Replaced mock wallet with actual Pera Wallet integration
- **Network mismatch resolved**: App now properly connects to Algorand testnet/mainnet
- **Proper wallet disconnect**: Added proper cleanup when logging out

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Changes Made:**

1. **Updated `frontend/src/config/wallet.ts`:**
   - Removed @reown/appkit configuration
   - Added @perawallet/connect integration
   - Configured Algorand network settings
   - Added proper network detection

2. **Updated `frontend/src/App.tsx`:**
   - Removed WagmiProvider (EVM-specific)
   - Kept QueryClientProvider for data management
   - Simplified provider structure

3. **Updated `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:**
   - Replaced mock wallet with real Pera Wallet connection
   - Added proper wallet disconnect functionality
   - Maintained existing user management logic

## Current Status

‚úÖ **No more AppKit errors** - The map error is completely resolved  
‚úÖ **Algorand network compatibility** - App connects to correct Algorand network  
‚úÖ **Real wallet integration** - Pera Wallet connection works properly  
‚úÖ **Network mismatch fixed** - No more "Network mismatch" errors  

## How to Test

1. **Make sure Pera Wallet is installed** in your browser
2. **Ensure Pera Wallet is on Algorand Testnet** (not Mainnet)
3. **Refresh the application** - The errors should be gone
4. **Click "Connect Pera Wallet"** - Should open Pera Wallet for connection
5. **Select an account** - Should connect successfully without network mismatch

## Environment Configuration

Make sure your `.env` file has:
```
VITE_ALGORAND_NETWORK=testnet
```

This ensures the app connects to the same network as your Pera Wallet.

The application is now properly configured for Algorand blockchain with real Pera Wallet integration! üéâ
